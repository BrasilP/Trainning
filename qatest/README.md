why you took that approach:
It was the simplest approach if compared to SpecFlow as it creates an additional layer of code and over head. I believe that SpecFlow would be more suitable to UI tests rather then API tests.

 and what would you do to make it better: (if you had more time/ideas/...)
 I would cover other tests scenarios but in regards to the current test structure I am very happy.
